# flexneet-movie-service

The pourpose of this project is to re-achieve frontend knowledge using React. The tech stack used to build it is quite simple: React as framework, Typescript, React-Bootstrap to style. The state is handled without any state mangaement tool, since it's not too big. The database is emulated using json data collected by [prust](https://github.com/prust/wikipedia-movie-data).

The project emulates a blockbuster service in which is possible to list movies, add to a list of favourites, sort in different ways (alphabetical, year, genre), see the descriptions and their data.
